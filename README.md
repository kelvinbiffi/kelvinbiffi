### 👋 Hello carbon-based bipedal lifeforms with opposable thumbs 😄
## Who am I

My name is Kelvin Batista Biffi Leote, aka Big Kelvin

I am a Software Engineering Technician, Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development and Post Graduated in Leadership and Coaching.

I study programming since 2009 and work in the field since 2011!

I am passionate about writing, programming, teaching and especially putting knowledge into practice.

In my free time I like to enjoy my family (:sparkling_heart:), play my projects (:computer:), exercise (:weight_lifting_man:), meditate (:lotus_position:) watch series (📺), read and write (📚) , enjoy good conversations accompanied by good drinks and food (:cheese::coffee::wine_glass:🍺).
